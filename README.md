A program for hydrological calculations, to which new sections will be added.

The first section is the calculation of spring flood water levels with a lack of hydrological observations.
The second section will be the calculation of water levels of rain floods and the construction of graphs.

Project structure:
- Hydro.db. Database with data required for calculations.
- spring_flood_design.ui. A file with a design made in Qt designer.
- spring_flood_design.py. A python-file with design.
- spring_flood.py. File with functions.
